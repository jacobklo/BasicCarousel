Thoughts on Build Systems

My current work use Jenkin CI a lot, but we do not have web applications.
So I don't have experiences on continuous build integration for web applications.

I do have some thoughts about it.


1) Production code should be obfuscate. This will increase security as it is much harder for hacker to decode. In C++ development, application is compiled and compiled application cannot be written with text editor.

2) Javascript library should be minify, only the code that needed should be created in production. This lower the size of the file, for better network performance.

3) CI should run automation tests. Although web page is front-end, that regression testing is more valuable, one of the best thing automation test can be done is performance testing. We need to make a web page as responsive as it can be, and using automation IDE, such as Selenium, we can test if a particular build has some slow down on performance. My current work have particular server that run performance tests on our C++ application.
